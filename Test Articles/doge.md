# Doge

Doge /ˈdoʊdʒ/ - DOHJ or /ˈdoʊɡ/ - DOHG is a meme of a shiba inu with comic-sans text overlaid representing the dog's inner thoughts. The meme became popular around 2013 and has since been adapted into many varieties.
## Description
### Format
The original format, popularised by the shiba-confessions tumblr, consisted of many small phrases in broken English placed all around the shiba in colourful comic-sans.

### Speech
Doge's speech is characterised by short one to two-word phrases that often use one of these five modifiers: "so", "such", "many", "much", and "very", though they should always be used with a word that they wouldn't normally modify:
- many words  ❌
- much words  ✔️

Apart from this, full sentences are allowed, but should be kept short with only a few being used. Apart from the rules mentioned above, spelling rules should be disregarded as much as possible while retaining text-legibility. And of course the text *must* be in comic sans and in a neon-colour.
## Origin
### Dogs
The original image is of Kabosu (かぼす), a shiba inu born on November 2nd, 2005, in Japan. So named, because her owner thought her face looked round like the kabosu fruit. In 2010 Atsuko Satō, Kabosu's owner uploaded a few pictures of her on their blog.
Another dog, Suki, who belonged to Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco, was also featured when his owner's wife accidentally put her scarf in the wash and shrunk it. Jonathan took a photo of Suki wearing the scarf which eventually also became a well-known meme image.
### Name
The name "doge" originated from a Homestar Runner episode from 2005, where Homestar tells Strongbad "You quack me up, that's why you're my D-O-G-E", to which Strongbad responds, "Your doge? (Pronounced with a soft G; /dʒ/) What are you talking about?".
Following this episode, doge had been in use for a while as a comical replacement for 'dog', before Kabosu's image went viral.
Pronunciations can vary quite wildly. The two most common in English are /ˈdoʊdʒ/ - DOHJ or /ˈdoʊɡ/ - DOHG, but some other variants include:
 - /ˈdɒdʒ/ - DODJ,
 - /ˈdɒɡi/ - DO-gee,
 - /ˈdɒɡeɪ/ - DOG-ay,
 - /ˈdoʊɡeɪ/ - DOH-gay, and
 - /ˈdɒɡ/ - DOG
### Memification
The image appeared on the "shiba confessions" tumblr board in 2010 which is where the comic sans inner-monologue overlay was popularised. Soon after, the image was posted to Reddit with the title "LMBO LOOK @ THIS FUKKEN DOGE" which began the meme's growth. Following this, in August of 2013, similar memes were spammed to r/MURICA by /b/.
The meme reached peak popularity in 2014. Its subsequent decline has been attributed to its use by the mainstream media and normies.
## Development
### New Variants
Though the original comic-sans-format died from normiefication, a less-popular variant of the meme sprung up, known as doge-lore. Mainly being housed on r/dogelore, this format has the original doge being edited to appear in various humorous situations. This included the creation of many side-characters, some from completely different images, some from various alterations of the original Kabosu.
