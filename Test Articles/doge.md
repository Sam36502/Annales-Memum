# Doge

Doge /ˈdoʊdʒ/ - DOHJ or /ˈdoʊɡ/ - DOHG is a meme of a shiba inu with comic-sans text overlaid representing the dog's inner thoughts. The meme became popular around 2013 and has since been adapted into many varieties.

## Origin
### Dogs
The original image is of Kabosu (かぼす), a shiba inu born on November 2nd, 2005, in Japan. So named, because her owner thought her face looked round like the kabosu fruit. In 2010 Atsuko Satō, Kabosu's owner uploaded a few pictures of her on their blog.

Another dog, Suki, who belonged to Jonathan Fleming from San Francisco, was also featured when his owner's wife accidentally put her scarf in the wash and shrunk it. Jonathan took a photo of Suki wearing the scarf which eventually also became a well-known meme image.
### Name
The name "doge" originated from a Homestar Runner episode from 2005, where Homestar tells Strongbad "You quack me up, that's why you're my D-O-G-E", to which Strongbad responds, "Your doge? (Pronounced with a soft G; /dʒ/) What are you talking about?".
Following this episode, doge had been in use for a while as a comical replacement for 'dog', before Kabosu's image went viral.
